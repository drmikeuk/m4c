## Expert supervision

You can draw on supervisory expertise from across the eight universities that comprise M4C. This allows you to find the perfect supervisory team for your project either within a single university or across the M4C institutions.

Your supervisory team should include at least two academic supervisors. Where relevant, your supervisory team may also include a member from a non-university partner organisation, for example from the cultural, creative or heritage sector.

[Collaborative Doctoral Awards](/m4c/projects.html) (CDAs) are co-designed between an M4C university and an external partner organisation. CDAs offer a project with established research aims, responding to particular needs in the cultural, creative and heritage sectors. The supervisory teams are pre-established and are made up of academics from a Midlands4Cities university and a member of the external partner organisation.

## Training:

We provide an extensive range of training opportunities to

Plus, regardless of your home university, you will have opportunities to access training offered by Graduate Schools and Doctoral Colleges across the Partnership, and apply for courses distinctive to our eight partner universities.

Additionally the **Midlands Arts Programme** provides a customised programme of research and employability training that enables you to explore what it means to be an arts and humanities researcher in the twenty-first century. This includes events that:

- develop skills
- deepen research networks
- path-find professional careers

## Virtual Postgraduate Platform (VPP)

The Virtual Postgraduate Platform (VPP) is a digital online hub specifically designed for Midlands4Cities doctoral researchers and supervisors. It provides a shared point of access for:

- training
- resources
- cohort activities
- professional development opportunities
- cross-institutional community-building

The VPP allows students and supervisors to share documentation, and for M4C students to network, communicate and present their research interests and activity through a searchable student profile space.

## Next steps

We offer two routes for PhD study:

1. **Open Doctoral Awards:**<br/>Student-led awards where you agree a research proposal with academic supervisors within the M4C partnership. There is the potential to build cross-institutional supervisory teams to maximize fit and expertise.

2. **Collaborative Doctoral Awards:**<br/>These awards are co-designed between an M4C university and an external partner organisation. CDAs offer a project with established research aims and supervisory teams including academics from the M4C partnership and a member of the external partner organisation.
