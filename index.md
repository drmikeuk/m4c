<p class="strap">Be part of a thriving community of doctoral students producing world-class research in the arts and humanities...</p>

The AHRC-funded Midlands4Cities Doctoral Training Partnership (M4C) brings together eight leading universities across the Midlands to support the professional and personal development of the next generation of arts and humanities doctoral researchers.

We provide:

- Studentship funding and enhanced support for professional training
- Expert supervision within and across our dynamic mix of university partners
- Networking and collaboration across the Midlands, nationally and internationally
- Links to leading cultural organisations and creative economy partners.


<h3>Apply</h3>
We offer two routes for PhD study: Student-led awards where you agree a research proposal with academic supervisors and Collaborative Doctoral Award which are co-designed between an M4C university and an external partner organisation.
