<h1>Find a supervisor</h1>

<!--
* Draw on the expertise from across the eight M4C universities to find the perfect supervisory team
* Your supervisory team should include at least two academic supervisors and may also include a member from a non-university partner organisation
-->

Create your supervisory team:

The Midlands4Cities eight universities provide doctoral researchers with access to exemplary world class expertise and supervisory support across the breadth of the AHRC research areas.

- Your supervisory team should include at least two academic supervisors.
- You can draw on supervisory expertise from across the eight universities that comprise M4C. This allows you to find the perfect supervisory team for your project either within a single university or across the M4C institutions.
- Where relevant, your supervisory team may also include a member from a non-university partner organisation, for example from the cultural, creative or heritage sector.



## Departmental websites

Visit the departmental websites at the M4C partner universities for a comprehensive list of M4C supervisors to ensure that you receive the best fit for the successful completion of your PhD research project.
